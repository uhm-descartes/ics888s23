# Solve a problem with Dart

For this assessment, you will be given a problem to solve using Dart within 30 minutes in class. 

It will require you to:
* Have the Dart SDK, GitHub Desktop, and IntelliJ installed on your laptop.
* Create a GitHub repo.
* Use DartPad and the Dart programming language to solve a problem.

You must work alone, but you can use any non-human Internet resources (Google, ChatGPT, etc.)

The actual problem, and submission instructions, will be provided in-class on the day of this assessment.
