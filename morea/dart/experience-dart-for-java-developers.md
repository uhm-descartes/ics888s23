# Introduction to Dart for Java Developers

For this experience, please go through the Intro to Dart for Java Developers codelab: <https://developers.google.com/codelabs/from-java-to-dart#0>

During the codelab, you should use the embedded DartPad environment to execute the examples.

Take your time, don’t rush, and make sure you understand every line of code and every sentence in this codelab! If you have questions or get stuck, post a message to our Discord server.

When you are done with the codelab, please do the following:
  * Create a private GitHub repository called “dart-scream”.
  * Clone it to your laptop.
  * Edit the scream application to produce the same output as Section 6 of this codelab
  * Commit your changes when finished.

## Submission instructions:
By the date and time associated with this assignment in Laulima, please submit the URL to your github repository.
